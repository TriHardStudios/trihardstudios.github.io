	<p>
		We are sorry to announce that Thresshold_ is being canceled. This program has been in development for almost 2 yrs and we have very little in terms of progress. We also have exsuased our development resources for this program. We have learned a lot about C++ from this program and ultimently, that was our goal for this program. Again, we are sorry to who ever has been following this project, but we need to move on to different things. Thank you.
