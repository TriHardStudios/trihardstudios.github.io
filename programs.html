		Thresshold_ is now at release 0.6.5! This release adds a lot of new features. First and foremost, the ablity to navigate folders, create folders, and delete files and empty directories. Also, the debug console has been greatly impoved with only one command needed to get all the debug info for a module. We are also happy to anouce that we are using a new program structure for debugging.. It is still under development but it should make into release with the next release of Thresshold_. There have been many stablity improvements. There is now activation for Tresshold_ as well. The development key is TOS-LW2016-WDEV. Stay tuned for 0.8.0!

			Today is the day. Today marks the second time in history that TriHard Studios has released a stable 1.0 release. (The first one was my take one the classic game Adventure from 1979). This build has no major bugs that would hamper its ability to work correctly. This is a standalone program meaning you don't have to install the java runtime in order to run it. Sorry about the seemingly huge install size though. Enjoy!
